# List
List values must be given within [] square braces.

List is mutable (modifiable)
* Tuple values must be given within () parenthesis.
* List values must be given within [] square braces.
* List is used to store group of values under same name.
* List allows duplicate values.
* List can store group of different type of values.
* List is indexed and ordered.

solution:

        <class 'list'>
        marks= [41, 86, 94, 74, 41, 58]
        41
        86
        94
        74
        41
        58
        
       
# functions which works on tuple, list, set and dict.

solution:

        minimum= 41
        maximum= 94
        sum= 415
        length= 6
        sorted marks= [41, 58, 62, 74, 86, 94]

# we can add 2 or 3 list together

solution:

       d= [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 9, 12, 4, 6, 8]
     
# List supports repetition

solution:

        b= [2, 5, 9, 2, 5, 9, 2, 5, 9]
        
# List supports slicing
 
 solution:

        [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
        [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]

# List functions 

 List is mutable(modifiable)
  *  Can insert single value using append function.
  * It adds the given value at the end of list.
    can insert single value using append function.

solution:

       [20, 80, 40, 20, 50, 80, 20, 15, 25, 35]
       
# can delete single value from list   

solution:  

       [80, 40, 20, 50, 80, 20]

# can update value

solution:

       [20, 80, 40, 60, 50]

# Clear Function

solution:

       a= [10, 20, 50, 60, 50, 20.3, '#', 'list']
       a= []


# Copy Function

Copy Function: This function used to copy entire list values to another list.

solution:

       a= [20, 23.5, '#', 'Hello']
       b= [20, 23.5, '#', 'Hello']
# Count Function and Index Function
* Count Function:  This function gives number of occurrences of gives element.
* Index Function: This function gives index of given values.

solution:

        3
        2
        1
        0
        0
        1
