# List
List values must be given within [] square braces.

List is mutable (modifiable)
* Tuple values must be given within () parenthesis.
* List values must be given within [] square braces.
* List is used to store group of values under same name.
* List allows duplicate values.
* List can store group of different type of values.
* List is indexed and ordered.

solution:

        <class 'list'>
        marks= [41, 86, 94, 74, 41, 58]
        41
        86
        94
        74
        41
        58
        
       
functions which works on tuple, list, set and dict.

solution:

        minimum= 41
        maximum= 94
        sum= 415
        length= 6
        sorted marks= [41, 58, 62, 74, 86, 94]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "C:/Users/Darshan /Desktop/functions which works on tuple, list, set and dict..py", line 9, in <module>
            print('marks=',marks)
        NameError: name 'marks' is not defined. Did you mean: 'vars'?
        
we can add 2 or 3 list together

solution:

       d= [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 9, 12, 4, 6, 8]
     
List supports repetition

solution:

        b= [2, 5, 9, 2, 5, 9, 2, 5, 9]
